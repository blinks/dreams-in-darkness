The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

== Introduction
_Dreams_ is a play-by-mail game for a facilitator (the *Conduit*) and three to seven other players (the *Ancients*).  It's a secrets-filled role-playing game about the end of a world.

To play, you need a good way to communicate and a shuffled Tarot deck for seeding the world with chaos.  You don't need to be sitting in the same room, or even in the same side of the planet -- as long as you can communicate somehow, you can play.  You'll also need pencils and paper, and a way to share the map after you've drawn it.

=== The Social Contract
To keep everything going it's helpful to set expectations: how often will you be contacting players, how long is acceptable for their response, and what will you do when someone drops or needs time off?  Answering these questions at the start can help reduce hurt feelings and missed expectations later on.  When the deck runs out, this tale ends but you may continue with another -- or even a direct sequel.  Make sure you revisit the social contract.

=== Followers
Players can only interact with the world through their followers.  These are mortals who managed to attune themselves to the players through ancient rituals, and can communicate with them.  Both the Conduit _and_ each ancient should keep track of followers -- the Conduit for everyone, the ancient for their own.  Shared spreadsheets can be nice for this.

Followers start at level 0 (The Fool) and each advancement up the Fool's Journey gains them abilities based on their player's playbook.  Followers also have four stats matching the four tarot suits: wands (W), cups (C), swords (S) and pentacles (P).  These correspond to similar characteristics (both positive and negative) as the suits in normal tarot.

Whenever a follower draws a card to resolve a conflict, they could grow in power.

- If they succeeded and the card helped, improve the matching stat(s) by one point.
- If they failed and the card hurt, advance them on the Fool's journey.

=== Moves
Scattered throughout this document are various things the Conduit might want to resolve without resorting to fiat.  In general, these look at the characteristics of the mortal attempting it (the four tarot suits) and draw a card to temporarily alter those characteristics.

Read "draw + WC - SP" as:

. Draw a card and apply its bonus (normally, doubling the matching suit).
. Take the acting mortal's wands x cups, and subtract their swords x pentacles.
. Zero or better is a hit, negative is a miss.
. Use the move results and the card itself to feed back into the fiction.

==== Breaking Stuff
When a follower attempts to break a physical obstacle, draw + CP - WS.  On a hit, it's no longer an obstacle.  On a miss, something else breaks.

When two followers duel, each of them draw + WS - CP and compare.  The loser dies.  On a tie, both lose.

==== Finding Stuff
When a follower recruits in a populated area, draw + CS - WP.  On a hit, name the new follower.  On a miss, the recruitment draws unwanted attention from the guilds.

When a follower searches for something hidden, draw + WC - SP.  On a hit, they find it, and they can find it again.  On a miss, they find something else.

==== Going Places
When followers travel across the map in a group, move them one area towards their destination and the leader draws + WP - CS.  On a hit, move the group another area if not already there.  On a miss, something delays their travel.

When a follower travels across the map alone, move them one area towards their destination and draw + WP - CS.  On a hit, move them the rest of the way there.  On a miss, something delays their travel.

[quote, A.E. Waite, The Pictorial Key to the Tarot (1910)]
The pathology of the poet says that "the undevout astronomer is mad"; the pathology of the very plain man says that genius is mad; and between these extremes, which stand for ten thousand analogous excesses, the sovereign reason takes the part of a moderator and does what it can.

== The Map
Grab link:voronoi.html[a copy of a voronoi diagram] with 22 sites, and shuffle up the major arcana.  For each site on the map: draw a card and write it's index (0, I, ... XXI) on that site.  Give everyone a copy of the map -- having shared place names is essential for coordination.  (North is up, too, or you'll just get confused.)

Each site starts with one specific point of interest.  If you've got the time, decorate your map to show them.

=== 0 The Fool
Beautiful high cliffs.

=== I The Magician
A quiet valley of wildflowers.

=== II The High Priestess
An ancient temple, mostly abandoned by now.

When the deck runs out, if eleven artifacts are gathered here under the eye of one ancient, they return to the world along with everyone in their pact.

=== III The Empress
Rolling fields of wheat.

=== IV The Emperor
A dormant volcano, dominating the landscape.

When a follower sacrifices themselves to the volcano, draw + WP - CS.  On a hit, they throw themselves in and the volcano erupts; in the ashes a relic will emerge.  On a miss, they can't summon the courage, and skip their next contact time.  The volcano might still erupt.

=== V The Hierophant
An enormous structure for holding mysterious ceremonies.

When several followers gather together here to form a pact for their ancients, that pact is almost impossible to break.

=== VI The Lovers
The black river: wide and slow-moving, dark and quiet.

=== VII The Chariot
A broken wall; once a symbol of a powerful empire, now only pieces remain.

=== VIII Strength
A forest, petrified before living memory.

=== IX The Hermit
The wasteland, a dangerous place to be for anyone.

=== X Wheel of Fortune
A deep lake in the forest.

=== XI Justice
The speaking stone of law, standing on a low hill.

=== XII The Hanged Man
A lonely tree, ropes still hanging from its branches.

=== XIII Death
Two stone towers. Some say the two mages still fight to this day.

=== XIV Temperance
Many get lost in this misty swamp searching for the old library.

=== XV The Devil
The broken table where sacrifices were made, once.

=== XVI The Tower
Ugarit was the first to burn when the war came.

=== XVII The Star
The lake Llyn Llydaw holds many secrets, some even tossed in willingly.

=== XVIII The Moon
The standing stones at the Ring of Brodgar are still used to track the stars.

When a follower stands here at night, draw + SP - WC.  On a hit, the Conduit will tell you how many cards are left in the deck.  On a miss, you'll find out what else watches the stars.

=== XIX The Sun
Sunflowers grow atop these hills.

=== XX Judgement
The entrance to these crypts has been lost for centuries.

=== XXI The World
The City of Gold is the center of this world's culture -- what little remains of it -- and the most populated area.

[quote, Ammurapi.]
My father behold, the enemy's ships came; my cities were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka? ... Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.

== Ancients
Players are immortal elder beings whose power is restrained somehow.  Their only connection to the world is through people who seek them out.  The only way they can communicate to the world is through visions.

=== Communication
The bloody membrane between worlds is thin between the ancients; you may contact them directly whenever you like. The mortal realm is further removed.  You will receive messages only when a mortal makes an effort to contact you, and send them only to mortals attuned to you who are asleep and dreaming.

The only way for you to interact with the world is through the mortals attuned to you, so be careful with them.

=== Playbooks

[verse, The Lost Book of Gideon.]
She laid the three stones below the altar,
words of power chanted through her.
The moment arrived, his eyes opened,
and she brought down the dagger.

image::dusk.jpg[]

== Visions
Play is a thread of messages.

The Conduit will contact you -- awakening your ancient -- when a mortal figures out the proper ritual.  They have no idea what they've uncovered, but your infinite power is overwhelming to any mortal will.  In their trance, they'll tell you something interesting and useful about the world above.

Whenever you like, you can message the Conduit with a reply.  Always state the vision you send, and the intention.  Sometimes you'll have difficulty knowing where to start: the Conduit is bound to tell you the truth (as far as they know it), and might suggest a course of action.

Your visions will arrive when next the mortals sleep.

Explicit orders they will follow exactly, to the best of their ability. You may be sure of what they will do, but will not take advantage of their instincts in the moment.

Vague orders they will attempt to interpret, but not in the evil genie sort of way. They will always act in your best interest as they see it and will adapt to the situation they are in, but you cannot be sure exactly what they will do.

Don't bother with contingency plans -- dreamers can't remember that much, nor can visions make them understood.

[quote, H.P. Lovecraft, The Colour out of Space.]
It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite.

== The Conduit
You set the pace and describe the world.  You'll need to know what each follower is currently attempting to do, and what else is going on in the world.  Each day in the world you should push the followers towards their goal and possibly draw for them, if a move is triggered.

Use the map -- keep a pawn or a die for each character on it, and move them around as the visions take them.  This is much easier than attempting to match current locations in a spreadsheet.

When drawing cards, no matter what you draw, reflect on the image and what it might mean before describing the outcome.  Record what happened (including the card) in a campaign log so you can share it when the game ends.

If a follower contacts their ancient, contact the player and speak from the follower's perspective, then continue resolving the day.  Responses come only when a follower is dreaming -- and might take a while.  Life goes on above.

When you message a player:

- Tell them the truth about what happened.
- Speak from the mouth of the follower.
- Push them into the way of another player.
- Encourage secrets, don't reveal them lightly.
- Use the names you've created.  Make new ones, as needed.
- Add subtle horrors to the message.
- Sometimes, ask one player to help detail what happens to another.

=== Major Arcana
When you draw major arcana, a relic is also unearthed during the conflict.  Contact any player you like and ask what it looks like and how to unlock its power.  It appears in the location of the action that triggered the card draw.
