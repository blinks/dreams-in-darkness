[verse, The National, The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness]
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

== Introduction
_Dreams_ is a play-by-mail game for a facilitator (the *Conduit*) and three to seven other players (the *Ancients*).  It's a secrets-filled role-playing game about the end of a world.

The game ends when the deck runs out.  If enough relics have been gathered at the right place, the people who control them win the game.  Otherwise, you'll have to wait for the next time the stars align.

To play, you need a good way to communicate and a shuffled Tarot deck for seeding the world with chaos.  You don't need to be sitting in the same room, or even in the same side of the planet -- as long as you can communicate somehow, you can play.  You'll also need pencils and paper, and a way to share the map after you've drawn it.

=== The Social Contract
To keep everything going it's helpful to set expectations: how often will you be contacting players, how long is acceptable for their response, and what will you do when someone drops or needs time off?  Answering these questions at the start can help reduce hurt feelings and missed expectations later on.

You -- the Conduit -- also need to introduce everyone at the start, so people know how to contact each other, and feel comfortable doing so.  You need to either present the schedule or moderate discussion about it.  You also need to set the tone. 

When the deck runs out, this tale ends but you may continue with another -- or even a direct sequel, if the world doesn't end.  Make sure you revisit the social contract.

=== Followers
Players can only interact with the world through their followers.  These are mortals who managed to attune themselves to the players through ancient rituals, and can communicate with them.  Both the Conduit _and_ each ancient should keep track of followers -- the Conduit for everyone, the ancient for their own.  Shared spreadsheets can be nice for this.

When a mortal is first attuned, they start at level 0 with four core _stats_, matching the four tarot suits: wands ({wands}), cups ({cups}), swords ({swords}) and pentacles ({pentacles}).  In pairs, they determine how that follower likes to act:

- Loud (unbridled, powerful) {wands}&times;{cups}
  / Quiet (patient, solitary) {swords}&times;{pentacles}
- Light (skilled, sharp, quick) {wands}&times;{swords}
  / Dark (wise, secretive, magical) {cups}&times;{pentacles}
- Hot (persuasive, diplomatic) {cups}&times;{swords}
  / Cold (stoic, solid) {wands}&times;{pentacles}
  
TIP: The stats correspond to similar characteristics (both positive and negative) as the suits in normal tarot, so if you're used to those your knowledge should hopefully transfer.  The approaches give a bit more flexibility when resolving visions.

When a stat changes, its approaches also change. Either don't forget or set up some kind of automation to help keep track.

When the follower's level advances, they gain new abilities.  TODO(playbooks)

=== Moves
Scattered throughout this document are various things the Conduit might want to resolve without resorting to fiat.  These are phrased as "moves", with a trigger ("when a follower _acts_..."), an approach ("...draw _Hot_...") and several outcomes ("on a hit, ... on a miss, ...").

. Determine the follower's bias: is the move's approach or its opposite stronger, and by how much?  The difference is the _bias_ -- positive if the approach is stronger, negative if the opposite is.
. Draw a card and apply its value to the bias: if the card matches the approach, push the bias positive. Otherwise, negative.  Major Arcana _never_ match the approach.
. If the final bias is negative, it's a miss.  Advance the follower's level.  Otherwise (including zero), it's a hit.  Advance the stat(s) that match the card.  When comparing results, the larger positive bias wins.
. Use the move results and the card itself to feed back into the fiction.

*When a follower attempts to break a physical obstacle, draw Loud.*  On a hit, it's no longer an obstacle.  On a miss, something else breaks.

*When two followers duel, each of them draw Light and compare.*  The loser dies.  On a tie, both lose.

*When a follower manipulates another mortal, draw Hot.*  On a hit, they get what they want.  On a miss, they get what they don't want.

*When a follower searches for something hidden, draw Dark.*  On a hit, they find it, and they can find it again.  On a miss, they find something else.

*When followers travel in a group, move them one area towards their destination and the leader draws Cold.*  On a hit, move the group another area if not already there.  On a miss, something delays their travel.

*When a follower travels alone, move them one area towards their destination and draw Quiet.*  On a hit, move them the rest of the way there.  On a miss, something delays their travel.

[quote, A.E. Waite, The Pictorial Key to the Tarot (1910)]
The pathology of the poet says that "the undevout astronomer is mad"; the pathology of the very plain man says that genius is mad; and between these extremes, which stand for ten thousand analogous excesses, the sovereign reason takes the part of a moderator and does what it can.

== The Map
Grab link:voronoi.html[a copy of a voronoi diagram] with 22 sites (North is up), and shuffle up the major arcana.  For each site on the map: draw a card and write it's index (0, I, ... XXI) on that site.  Each site has a corresponding description, so draw in other important features -- like streets and bodies of water and canals -- to match.  Everyone should have a copy of the map.

NOTE: The current plan is to probably have multiple playsets, of which this is the first.

=== The Ruins of Ugarit

[quote, Ammurapi.]
My father behold, the enemy's ships came; my cities were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka? ... Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.

== Ancients
Players are immortal elder beings whose power is restrained somehow.  Their only connection to the world is through people who seek them out.  The only way they can communicate to the world is through visions.

=== Communication
The bloody membrane between worlds is thin between the ancients; you may contact them directly whenever you like. The mortal realm is further removed.  You will receive messages only when a mortal makes an effort to contact you, and send them only to mortals attuned to you who are asleep and dreaming.

The only way for you to interact with the world is through the mortals attuned to you, so be careful with them.

=== Playbooks

[verse, The Lost Book of Gideon.]
She laid the three stones below the altar,
words of power chanted through her.
The moment arrived, his eyes opened,
and she brought down the dagger.

== Visions
Play is a thread of messages.

The Conduit will contact you -- awakening your ancient -- when a mortal figures out the proper ritual.  They have no idea what they've uncovered, but your infinite power is overwhelming to any mortal will.  In their trance, they'll tell you something interesting and useful about the world above.

Whenever you like, you can message the Conduit with a reply.  Always state the vision you send, and the intention.  Sometimes you'll have difficulty knowing where to start: the Conduit is bound to tell you the truth (as far as they know it), and might suggest a course of action.

Your visions will arrive when next the mortals sleep.

Explicit orders they will follow exactly, to the best of their ability. You may be sure of what they will do, but will not take advantage of their instincts in the moment.

Vague orders they will attempt to interpret, but not in the evil genie sort of way. They will always act in your best interest as they see it and will adapt to the situation they are in, but you cannot be sure exactly what they will do.

Don't bother with contingency plans -- dreamers can't remember that much, nor can visions make them understood.

[quote, H.P. Lovecraft, The Colour out of Space.]
It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite.

== The Conduit
You set the pace and describe the world.  You'll need to know what each follower is currently attempting to do, and what else is going on in the world.  Each day in the world you should push the followers towards their goal and possibly draw for them, if a move is triggered.

Use the map -- keep a pawn or a die for each character on it, and move them around as the visions take them.  This is much easier than attempting to match current locations in a spreadsheet.

When drawing cards, no matter what you draw, reflect on the image and what it might mean before describing the outcome.  Record what happened (including the card) in a campaign log so you can share it when the game ends.

If a follower contacts their ancient, contact the player and speak from the follower's perspective, then continue resolving the day.  Responses come only when a follower is dreaming -- and might take a while.  Life goes on above.

When you message a player:

- Tell them the truth about what happened.
- Speak from the mouth of the follower.
- Push them into the way of another player.
- Encourage secrets, don't reveal them lightly.
- Use the names you've created.  Make new ones, as needed.
- Add subtle horrors to the message.
- Sometimes, ask one player to help detail what happens to another.
