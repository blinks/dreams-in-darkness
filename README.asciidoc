[verse, The National, The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness]
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

== The basics
A secrets-filled, competitive role-playing game set in a Napoleonic-era dark
fantasy for three to fifteen players about the end of a world.

=== Preparations
Get as many people as you can, divided into two roughly-equal teams and one
dreamer. Since this is the dreamer's book, that's you.

Dreams in Darkness can be played in one long-ish session locally, or over a
bunch of messages remotely, you pick. There's a definite end to each game,
though: try to reach it.

Each game starts with a situation, primed for conflict between the two sides.
Fill in the details of the situation and let the game begin.

=== Kriegsspiel
Role-playing may be a conversation, but Dreams in Darkness is a kriegsspiel,
different in two primary ways: fog of war and limited communication.

Both of these limitations seal players off into their own areas, with knowledge
only of their immediate surroundings, any communication delayed and potentially
intercepted. These are essential to the experience, don't play around them!

These rules mediate how players wander through the fog, so everyone can make
informed decisions about what could happen.

=== The Ancients
Two players can escape these limitations: the Ancients. These are the two
warring sides, and sit at the same table with the dreamer. All the other
players are Disciples that follow one of the Ancients, and can commune with
them in person once each day.

=== Orders and cards
Disciples wander through the fog by giving orders. All the character playbooks
list the same set of basic orders, plus each playbook lists special orders for
just that archetype.

The rule for orders is that the dreamer will interpret them to the best of
their ability. Be clear if you want to be understood. No takebacks, no
contingency plans. Orders must be simple and direct.

The Ancients each hold a small hand of Tarot cards, representing their power.
Minor Arcana can be granted to disciples to aid them for a turn, increasing the
spheres that match. Major Arcana are artifacts that can be granted to a
disciple.

=== The spheres
The spheres are:

The Sun:: A conflict of raw power or strength. When you charge into battle or
  tear something apart, count Cups and Pentacles in your favor.

Mercury:: A conflict of speed or skill. When you run to intercept an enemy or
  carefully explore a ruin, count Wands and Swords in your favor.

Venus:: A conflict of persuasion. When you negotiate with a neutral party or
  interrogate a deserter, count Cups and Swords in your favor.

The Moon:: A conflict of wisdom, secrets, or magic. When you cast a spell or
  seek out forbidden knowledge, count Wands and Cups in your favor.

Mars:: A conflict of courage or constitution. When you march without rest or
	hold steady in the face of a charge, count Wands and Pentacles in your favor.

Saturn:: A conflict of patience or solitude. When you depend on critical timing
  or you travel alone, count Swords and Pentacles in your favor.

Jupiter:: A conflict of pure luck. When the fates matter more than anything else,
  count any Minor Arcana in your favor.

=== Cycle of play
. The Ancients draw a card.
. The dreamer presents each Disciple with their current situation.
. Disciples write orders, optionally communing with their Ancients.
. The dreamer resolves orders, asking Ancients for cards as necessary.

== The playbooks
Disciples choose from these six playbooks before play. Within a team, playbooks
should be unique.

=== King
You sacrificed much to gain arcane power. A little bit more won't hurt.

=== Queen
Sometimes all you need is the right person in the right place with the right
knife.

=== Bishop
You follow willingly, in order to act as a conduit for divine power.

=== Knight
Swords, horses, and courage solve any problem worth solving.

=== Rook
Talk softly and carry a big siege weapon.

=== Pawn
You know the land better than anyone -- the hidden paths, dark tombs, sacred
places. Your enemies don't understand what they're walking into.

=== The basic orders
Every disciple gets all of the basic orders. These are:

- Charge into battle
- Tear something apart
- Intercept a moving enemy
- Explore a hidden place
- Negotiate with a neutral party
- Interrogate a deserter
- Invoke arcane power
- Seek forbidden knowledge
- March without rest
- Hold steady
- Watch and wait
- Travel alone

[verse, Ammurapi]
My father behold, the enemy’s ships came;
my cities were burned, and they did evil things in my country.
Does not my father know that
all my troops and chariots are in the Land of Hatti,
and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka? ...
Thus, the country is abandoned to itself.
May my father know it:
the seven ships of the enemy that came here
inflicted much damage upon us.

== Character creation

[verse,H.P. Lovecraft, The Colour out of Space.]
It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite.

Print out two sets of playbooks and give a set to each ancient. Within each
team, have everybody choose one, no duplicates. Set the rest aside.

You'll also need enough copies of the map so everyone can get one, some
pencils, and a deck of tarot cards.

Then, hold an auction for each sphere in turn (from the outermost to the
innermost):

. Saturn: patience and solitude.
. Mars: courage and constitution.
. The Moon: wisdom, secrets, and magic.
. Venus: charisma and persuasion.
. Mercury: speed and skill.
. The Sun: raw power and strength.

Players have 150 points to spend in the auction. Bids are irrevocable and
nonrefundable. The final bid for each player in each sphere is their score in
that attribute. After all bids are complete, players may spend leftover points
to increase their score in any sphere, but not past a bid rank.

That is, if Alice got 54 in Mars and Bob got 35, he could spend up to 19 points
getting up to 54. When tied, the score that was initially bid higher always
wins. (In the case where two players tie in different spheres, TODO.)

=== Goals
To the ancients: play to win creatively.
To the disciples: play to satisfy your obligations.
To the dreamer: play to find out.

=== The situation
A ritual has begun that will grant one ancient unlimited power. The other
ancient needs to prevent it from doing so.

=== The basic orders
*Charging into battle* means going on the offensive against an enemy you can
see. The order determines whether your enemy can stand up to your charge, or if
their morale fails them and they flee.

*Tearing something apart* means destroying a building or a barrier, natural or
constructed. The order determines how destructive you were and what else happens
as a consequence.

*Intercepting a moving enemy* means catching someone on the move, and stopping
them from reaching their goal. The order determines if and where you catch
them, and who's in the best position to take advantage of your meeting.

*Exploring a hidden place* means delving into a detail the dreamer described.
The areas on the map are large and the map itself is vague. The order determines
what you find there and what effect it has on you.

*Negotiating with a neutral party* means convincing a non-player character or
group to act (or avoid acting) in a particular way. You cannot negotiate with
disciples, they're all fanatics. The order determines whether they agree, and
what they need from you in return.

*Interrogating a deserter* means getting information out of those who were in
contact with the enemy for a time and then left. The order determines how much
you learn from your interrogation, and whether it's truthful. (You learn only
the first from the dreamer.)

*Invoking arcane power* means casting a spell or using an artifact's ability.
The order determines the effect and what it costs you.

*Seeking forbidden knowledge* means poring over books, scrolls, or runes to
learn of secret places, spells, or powers lost to the ages. The order
determines how much you learn, and what it costs you.

*Marching without rest* means forcing yourself to travel farther than is
healthy.  The order determines what it costs you, and how far you make it.

*Holding steady* means preparing yourself for something terrible on the
horizon. The order determines whether you stand your ground or run.

*Watching and waiting* means looking for the point of most leverage and acting
on it. The order determines how much leverage you managed to get.

*Traveling alone* means going quietly and stealthily through an area to avoid
notice. The order determines whether anyone was able to trace your passage.

[verse,The Lost Book of Gideon.]
She laid the three stones below the altar,
words of power chanted through her.
The moment arrived, his eyes opened,
and she brought down the dagger.
