[verse, The National, The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness]
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

== Introduction
_Dreams_ is a play-by-mail game for a facilitator (the *Conduit*) and three to six other players (the *Ancients*).  It's a secrets-filled role-playing game about what happens when plans come into conflict.

To play, you need a good way to communicate and a shuffled Tarot deck for seeding the world with chaos.  You don't need to be sitting in the same room, or even in the same side of the planet -- as long as you can communicate somehow, you can play.  You'll also need pencils and paper, and a way to share the map after you've drawn it.

=== The Social Contract
To keep everything going it's helpful to set expectations: how often will you be contacting players, how long is acceptable for their response, and what will you do when someone drops or needs time off?  Answering these questions at the start can help reduce hurt feelings and missed expectations later on.  When the deck runs out, this tale ends but you may continue with another -- or even a direct sequel.  Make sure you revisit the social contract.

[quote, A.E. Waite, The Pictorial Key to the Tarot (1910)]
The pathology of the poet says that "the undevout astronomer is mad"; the pathology of the very plain man says that genius is mad; and between these extremes, which stand for ten thousand analogous excesses, the sovereign reason takes the part of a moderator and does what it can.

== The Map
Grab link:voronoi.html[a copy of a voronoi diagram] with 22 sites, and shuffle up the major arcana.  For each site on the map: draw a card, look up its point of interest, and write it down in the site.  Perhaps draw a little picture.

Give everyone a copy of the map -- having shared place names is essential for coordination.  (North is up, too, or you'll just get confused.)

The Fool::
  *The White Cliffs*: chalk cliffs, overlooking a body of water.

The Magician::
  *The Valley of Flowers*: a quiet valley of wildflowers.

[quote, Ammurapi.]
My father behold, the enemy's ships came; my cities were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka? ... Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.

== Ancients
Players are immortal elder beings whose power is restrained somehow.  Their only connection to the world is through people who seek them out.  The only way they can communicate to the world is through visions.

At the start of the game, the Conduit will shuffle up the major arcana, and secretly deal out three cards to each player: each gives a secret prophecy, attuned artifact, and cultist trait.

NOTE: It might be better to write down a list of the players, deal two to each, and then deal one more between each pair (including the first and last).  This means four cards per player, two shared.

Each prophecy is attuned to a powerful artifact, lost for ages.  If they emerge in play, the Conduit will ask you what they look like and how their power might be accessed, but you won't know who ends up holding them.

The moment arrived, his eyes opened,
and she brought down the dagger.

== Visions
The bloody membrane between worlds is thin between the ancients; you may contact them directly whenever you like. The mortal realm is further removed.  You will receive messages only when a mortal makes an effort to contact you, and send them only to mortals attuned to you who are asleep and dreaming.

Once the map is built and the prophecies are written, the game proper can begin.

The conduit will contact you -- awakening your ancient -- when a cultist figures out the proper ritual.  They have no idea what they've uncovered, but your infinite power is overwhelming to any mortal will.  In their trance, they'll tell you something about the world above and ask for a task.  Always state the vision you send, and the intention.  Sometimes you'll have difficulty knowing where to start: the Conduit is bound to tell you the truth (as far as they know it), and might suggest a course of action.

As they sleep, you may send your cultists any visions you like. Explicit orders they will follow exactly, to the best of their ability. You may be sure of what they will do, but will not take advantage of the cultist's instincts in the moment. Vague orders they will attempt to interpret, but not in the evil genie sort of way. They will always act in your best interest as they see it and will adapt to the situation they are in, but you will not be sure exactly what they will do.  Don't bother with contingency plans -- cultists can't remember that much, nor can visions make them understood.

[quote, H.P. Lovecraft, The Colour out of Space.]
It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite.

== The Conduit
You set the pace and describe the world.  You do this by finding _conflicts,_ figuring out the possible results, drawing to inject some chaos, and reporting back to the players.

Before you draw, you should have a critical moment in mind: the knife coming down, eyes searching the forgotten library, the bargaining table.  Use the map -- keep a pawn or a die for each cultist on it, and move them around as the visions take them.  When two cultists meet tends to be a critical moment -- use their traits to determine what that meeting looks like.  When a plan comes to a head is another -- figure out what could go wrong and draw for it.

Anytime the outcome is uncertain is a possible critical moment.  This could be a cultist attempting something interesting and risky, or two cultists wanting different things in the same place.  Divide participants into at most three groups: the attackers, the defenders, and the bystanders.  The first two groups are in opposition, and you'll be drawing for the attackers.  If you don't have anybody for the defender group, create somebody: perhaps a monstrous force, perhaps still human, perhaps traps or just difficult terrain.

Determine the sphere of conflict:

The Sun:: A conflict of raw power or strength.
Mercury:: A conflict of speed or skill.
Venus:: A conflict of persuasion.
The Moon:: A conflict of wisdom, secrets, or magic.
Mars:: A conflict of courage or constitution.
Saturn:: A conflict of patience or solitude.
Jupiter:: A conflict of pure luck.

Weigh everything on the scales (think character traits, equipment and magical effects, the landscape, and so on) and come up with an obvious, interesting outcome.  Then draw:

- If you draw major arcana, a relic is unearthed during the conflict.  Contact the player attuned to it and ask what it looks like and how to unlock its power.
- If you draw a court card (page, knight, queen, or king), an important character appears.  Perhaps a new cultist, perhaps just someone important to the setting.  Decide which side they're on, and what they mean to the situation.
- If you draw an ace, the plan succeeds wildly, and the attackers gain power; give them a new aspect reflecting their growth in the sphere of conflict.

No matter what you draw, reflect on the image and what it might mean, updating your outcome with that understanding.  Record both the card and the outcome you chose in a campaign log.  Contact the player with the situation from the cultists perspective, and pick another conflict to resolve.  Responses come only when the cultist is dreaming -- and might take a while.  Life goes on above.

When you message a player:

- Tell them the truth about what happened.
- Speak from the mouth of the cultist.
- Push them into the way of another player.
- Encourage secrets, don't reveal them lightly.
- Use the names you've created.  Make new ones, as needed.
- Add subtle horrors to the message.
- Sometimes, ask one player to help detail what happens to another.
