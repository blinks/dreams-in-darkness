The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

== Introduction
_Dreams_ is a play-by-mail game for a facilitator (the *Conduit*) and three to
seven other players (the *Ancients*).  It's a secrets-filled role-playing game
about the end of a world.

The game ends when enough relics have been gathered at the right place. The
people who control them win the game as they return to destroy the world.

To play, you need a good way to communicate and a Tarot deck for seeding the
world with chaos.  You don't need to be sitting in the same room, or even in
the same side of the planet -- as long as you can communicate somehow, you can
play.  You'll also need pencils and paper, and a way to share the map after
you've drawn it.

=== The Social Contract
To keep everything going it's helpful to set expectations: how often will you
be contacting players, how long is acceptable for their response, and what will
you do when someone drops or needs time off?  Answering these questions at the
start can help reduce hurt feelings and missed expectations later on.

You -- the Conduit -- also need to introduce everyone at the start, so people
know how to contact each other, and feel comfortable doing so.  You need to
either present the schedule or moderate discussion about it.  You also need to
set the tone.  I've found that the simplest way to run the game is to set your
own schedule for responses based on how often you'll be able to block off time.
On that schedule, respond to everyone that sent you an update, and leave out
anyone who hasn't.

=== Followers
Players can only interact with the world through their followers. These are
mortals who managed to attune themselves to the players through ancient
rituals, and can communicate with them. As with any character in the game, give
these people unique names and evocative one-liner descriptions.

[quote, A.E. Waite, The Pictorial Key to the Tarot (1910)]
The pathology of the poet says that "the undevout astronomer is mad"; the
pathology of the very plain man says that genius is mad; and between these
extremes, which stand for ten thousand analogous excesses, the sovereign reason
takes the part of a moderator and does what it can.

== The Map
In the middle of a sheet of paper, draw a circle and six circles around it.
These seven areas are the ruins of Ugarit.  Shuffle the deck and draw for each
location.

[quote, Ammurapi.]
My father behold, the enemy's ships came; my cities were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka? ... Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.

== Ancients
Players are immortal elder beings whose power is restrained somehow.  Their
only connection to the world is through people who seek them out.  The only way
they can communicate to the world is through visions.

The bloody membrane between worlds is thin between the ancients; you may
contact them directly whenever you like. The mortal realm is further removed.
You will receive messages only when a mortal makes an effort to contact you,
and send them only to mortals attuned to you who are asleep and dreaming.

The only way for you to interact with the world is through the mortals attuned
to you, so be careful with them.

The Conduit will give you a few specific relics to describe before the game
begins. Do so, knowing that you won't necessarily be the one to get hold of
them.

[verse, The Lost Book of Gideon.]
She laid the three stones below the altar,
words of power chanted through her.
The moment arrived, his eyes opened,
and she brought down the dagger.

== Visions
Play is a thread of messages.

The Conduit will contact you with your dreams, in three parts: something that
happened recently that you overheard (sent to the group), something that's
happening now, and something that could happen in the future.  They'll ask you
a question about each of these.  Respond when you have time.

In addition to answering the Conduit's questions, you can send visions to any
character you can name.  Always describe the vision you send, and your
intention.  Sometimes you'll have difficulty knowing where to start: the
Conduit is bound to tell you the truth (as far as they know it), and might
suggest a course of action.

Your visions will arrive when next the mortals sleep.

Explicit orders they will follow exactly, to the best of their ability. You may
be sure of what they will do, but will not take advantage of their instincts in
the moment.

Vague orders they will attempt to interpret, but not in the evil genie sort of
way. They will always act in your best interest as they see it and will adapt
to the situation they are in, but you cannot be sure exactly what they will do.

Don't bother with contingency plans -- dreamers can't remember that much, nor
can visions make them understood.

[quote, H.P. Lovecraft, The Colour out of Space.]
It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite.

== The Conduit
You set the pace and describe the world.  You'll need to know where each
character and each relic are, and what else is going on in the world.  Use the
map -- note where each character is, so you can understand who runs into each
other.

On a regular schedule, record what's currently happening as a new chapter in
the game log. Each player's descriptions should be in their own section of the
chapter, so you can keep the authors straight. Compose a response for each
player who sent you a message:

. Answer truthfully any questions they've had.  System questions should be
  answered in public, without pointing towards the one with the question.
. Ponder the current overall situation (especially the most recent messages
  from all players) while you shuffle the deck.
. Draw three cards: past, present, and future.
  . For the first card, describe something that happened recently, outside
    their control. They get visions of the entire world, snippets of other
    events happening far away. Send this to the group (in a batch).
  . For the second card, describe the result of their most recent orders. Let
    the card guide whether the orders succeed or not, but err on the side of
    success without outside interference. Ask a question about what happened.
  . For the third card, describe an opportunity, with or without a cost. Ask a
    question about that opportunity or its cost.
. Add these questions to the game log, for posterity and so you can keep the
  thread when responses don't contain enough information to remember the
  question.

.Example message.
====

(The Magician) You see another man in Rapanu's Library, one heavily-laden with
books, climb a bookcase to take one final tome.  He hears footsteps, and runs
off into the night. (Sent to all.)

(6 of Wands) You see Saladin, bearing a stone game piece (the Tower) and a
large wooden bowl (Temperance), entering the library at dawn, proud and
upright.  He begins searching for the book, but he will not find it. What is
the title of the book Saladin thinks will appease you?

(The Wheel) During Saladin's search, he notices a body out a window to the
south, across the river in the marketplace.  The crows are avoiding it, though
it's certainly dead.  There's something in its outstretched hand... Why is the
marketplace normally empty?
