The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

== Introduction
_Dreams_ is a play-by-mail game for a facilitator (the *Conduit*) and two to fourteen other players (the *Ancients* and *Disciples*).  It's a secrets-filled role-playing game about the end of a world.

To play, you need a good way to communicate and a shuffled Tarot deck for seeding the world with chaos.  You don't need to be sitting in the same room, or even in the same side of the planet -- as long as you can communicate somehow, you can play.  You'll also need pencils and paper, and a way to share the map after you've drawn it.

=== The Social Contract
To keep everything going it's helpful to set expectations: how often will you be contacting players, how long is acceptable for their response, and what will you do when someone drops or needs time off?  Answering these questions at the start can help reduce hurt feelings and missed expectations later on.

[quote, A.E. Waite, The Pictorial Key to the Tarot (1910)]
The pathology of the poet says that "the undevout astronomer is mad"; the pathology of the very plain man says that genius is mad; and between these extremes, which stand for ten thousand analogous excesses, the sovereign reason takes the part of a moderator and does what it can.

== The Map
Grab link:voronoi.html[a copy of a voronoi diagram] with 22 sites, and shuffle up the major arcana.  For each site on the map: draw a card, look up its point of interest, and write it down in the site.  Perhaps draw a little picture.

Give everyone a copy of the map -- having shared place names is essential for coordination.  (North is up, too, or you'll just get confused.)

The Fool::
  *The White Cliffs*: chalk cliffs, overlooking a body of water.

The Magician::
  *The Valley of Flowers*: a quiet valley of wildflowers.

The High Priestess::
  *The Temple of Solomon*: an ancient temple, mostly abandoned by now.

The Empress::
  *The Wheat Fields*: no longer actively farmed, still useful to some.

The Emperor::
  *The Lonely Mountain*: a dormant volcano, dominating the landscape.

The Hierophant::
  *Great Hall Telesterion*: an enormous structure for holding mysterious ceremonies.

The Lovers::
  *The Black River*: wide and slow-moving, dark and quiet.

The Chariot::
  *The Broken Wall*: once a symbol of a powerful empire, now only pieces remain.

The Hanged Man::
  *The Ceiba Tree*: ropes still hang from its branches.

Death::
  *The Two Towers*: some say the two mages still fight to this day.

Temperance::
  *The Fens*: many get lost in this misty swamp searching for the old library.

The Devil::
  *The Broken Table*: sacrifices were made, once.

The Tower::
  *The Ruins of Ugarit*: the first to burn when the war came.

The Star::
  *Llyn Llydaw*: this lake holds many secrets, some even tossed in willingly.

The Moon::

[quote, Ammurapi.]
My father behold, the enemy's ships came; my cities were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka? ... Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.

== Ancients
Two players are immortal elder beings whose power is constrained.  Their only connection to the world is through people who seek them out.  The only way they can communicate to the world is through visions. The two players acting as Ancients each choose a domain, with an associated power granted if they give up a card draw for that turn.

- Knowledge: you can see the true map and all but the last of your opponent's cards.
- Life: you can heal and raise the dead in one area.
- Light: you can create and manipulate fire in one area.
- Nature: you can connect living things in two distant areas.
- Tempest: you can bring the storm in one area.
- Trickery: you can hide the result of one of your followers' plans.
- War: you can grant an additional card to each of your followers in combat this turn. 

=== Communication
The bloody membrane between worlds is thin between the ancients; they may contact each other directly whenever they like. The mortal realm is further removed.  You will be able to communicate with a disciple only when they make an effort to contact you.

The only way for you to interact with the world is through those mortals attuned to you, so be careful with them.

== Disciples
The rest of the players (aside from the Conduit) are playing Disciples. Split up allegiance between the two Ancients, and choose a playbook:

- Barbarian: you and your tribe are on horseback, and can move an additional area each turn.
- Cleric: you can use some of your god's power, if they grant it to you.
- Fighter: you lead a corps of crusaders, disciplined and hard.
- Ranger: you lead a small crew of special forces, and get an extra card when you do something sneaky.
- Wizard: you are bound by geas to the god who granted you power, but have lots of spell choice.

== Visions
Play is a thread of messages. One thread per day, each day split into turns: morning, mid-day, afternoon, evening, and night.

At the beginning of each turn, the Conduit will contact you. For Ancients, you will get a hand of seven cards at the start of the game, and one new card each turn from then on. If you want to use an ability, you can refuse the card draw. For Disciples, you will learn about your current situation, including how your plans went last turn, if any.

Disciples can then contact their Ancients in prayer, both for orders and for boons and for information. Ancients may _not_ open contact with their Disciples.

Whenever you like, you can message the Conduit with a reply. For Ancients, your reply should include the cards you're granting to each Disciple, and how you use your power, if available. For Disciples, your reply should include your plan for the turn:

- Adventure (Wands): explore ruins, charge into battle, delve into a tomb.
- Intrigue (Cups): sow dissent, spy on plans, go unnoticed.
- Research (Swords): find a hidden path, uncover the map, learn a weakness.
- Toil (Pentacles): construct siegeworks, ford a river, cross a mountain range.

You may move to an adjacent area before your plan, though difficult movement will take up your plan as well.

At the appointed time, the Conduit will gather the cards from the Ancients, and the plans of the Disciples, and resolve everything. If you have not responded by that time, you gain nothing. No response from an Ancient means one card drawn at random for each of their Disciples. No response from a Disciple means they make no plan and remain where they are.

To resolve a plan, look at the Disciple's strength and their skill. Their strength determines how many 10-sided dice they get to roll, and their skill determines how many they get to count towards the result. Normally, a Disciple's strength is one. Cards from their Ancient can increase this, based on the card's rank.

TODO: Plan specifics, and attack/defend/feint/maneuver stances.

[quote, H.P. Lovecraft, The Colour out of Space.]
It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite.

== The Conduit
You set the pace and describe the world. When you message a player:

- Tell them the truth about what happened.
- Push them into the way of another player.
- Encourage secrets, don't reveal them lightly.
- Use the names you've created.  Make new ones, as needed.
- Add subtle horrors.
- Sometimes, ask one player to help detail what happens to another.

=== Major Arcana
When a player succeeds where Major Arcana was spent, a relic is also granted to that player's Disciple.  Ask the Ancients what it looks like and how to unlock its power.
