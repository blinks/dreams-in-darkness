The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

== Introduction
_Dreams_ is a play-by-mail game for a facilitator (the *Conduit*) and three to seven other players (the *Ancients*).  It's a secrets-filled role-playing game about the end of a world.

The game ends when enough relics have been gathered at the right place. The people who control them win the game as they return to destroy the world.

To play, you need a good way to communicate and a Tarot deck for seeding the world with chaos.  You don't need to be sitting in the same room, or even in the same side of the planet -- as long as you can communicate somehow, you can play.  You'll also need pencils and paper, and a way to share the map after you've drawn it.

=== The Social Contract
To keep everything going it's helpful to set expectations: how often will you be contacting players, how long is acceptable for their response, and what will you do when someone drops or needs time off?  Answering these questions at the start can help reduce hurt feelings and missed expectations later on.

You -- the Conduit -- also need to introduce everyone at the start, so people know how to contact each other, and feel comfortable doing so.  You need to either present the schedule or moderate discussion about it.  You also need to set the tone.  I've found that the simplest way to run the game is to set your own schedule for responses based on how often you'll be able to block off time.  On that schedule, respond to everyone that sent you an update, and leave out anyone who hasn't.

=== Followers
Players can only interact with the world through their followers. These are mortals who managed to attune themselves to the players through ancient rituals, and can communicate with them. As with any character in the game, give these people unique names and evocative one-liner descriptions.

[quote, A.E. Waite, The Pictorial Key to the Tarot (1910)]
The pathology of the poet says that "the undevout astronomer is mad"; the pathology of the very plain man says that genius is mad; and between these extremes, which stand for ten thousand analogous excesses, the sovereign reason takes the part of a moderator and does what it can.

== The Map
Grab link:voronoi.html[a copy of a voronoi diagram] with 22 sites (North is up), and shuffle up the major arcana.  For each site on the map: draw a card and write it's index (0, I, ... XXI) on that site.  Each site has a corresponding description, so draw in other important features -- like streets and bodies of water and canals -- to match.  Everyone should have a copy of the map.

NOTE: Perhaps there should just be one static map, so it can have great art and be easy to share with everyone. A procedurally-generated map doesn't add much to the game besides a bunch of work.

Each location begins with its associated relic.  The players already know where all the relics are at the start of the game.

NOTE: The current plan is to probably have multiple playsets, of which this is the first.

=== The Ruins of Ugarit

[quote, Ammurapi.]
My father behold, the enemy's ships came; my cities were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka? ... Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.

== Ancients
Players are immortal elder beings whose power is restrained somehow.  Their only connection to the world is through people who seek them out.  The only way they can communicate to the world is through visions.

The bloody membrane between worlds is thin between the ancients; you may contact them directly whenever you like. The mortal realm is further removed.  You will receive messages only when a mortal makes an effort to contact you, and send them only to mortals attuned to you who are asleep and dreaming.

The only way for you to interact with the world is through the mortals attuned to you, so be careful with them.

The Conduit will give you a few specific relics to describe before the game begins. Do so, knowing that you won't necessarily be the one to get hold of them.

[verse, The Lost Book of Gideon.]
She laid the three stones below the altar,
words of power chanted through her.
The moment arrived, his eyes opened,
and she brought down the dagger.

== Visions
Play is a thread of messages.

The Conduit will contact you with your dreams, in three parts: something that happened recently that you overheard, something that's happening now, and something that could happen in the future.  They'll ask you a question about each of these.  Respond when you have time.

In addition to answering the Conduit's questions, you can send visions to any character you can name.  Always describe the vision you send, and your intention.  Sometimes you'll have difficulty knowing where to start: the Conduit is bound to tell you the truth (as far as they know it), and might suggest a course of action.

Your visions will arrive when next the mortals sleep.

Explicit orders they will follow exactly, to the best of their ability. You may be sure of what they will do, but will not take advantage of their instincts in the moment.

Vague orders they will attempt to interpret, but not in the evil genie sort of way. They will always act in your best interest as they see it and will adapt to the situation they are in, but you cannot be sure exactly what they will do.

Don't bother with contingency plans -- dreamers can't remember that much, nor can visions make them understood.

[quote, H.P. Lovecraft, The Colour out of Space.]
It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite.

== The Conduit
You set the pace and describe the world.  You'll need to know where each character and each relic are, and what else is going on in the world.  Use the map -- keep a pawn or a die for each character on it, and move them around as the visions take them.

On a regular schedule, record what's currently happening as a new chapter in the game log. Each player's descriptions should be in their own section of the chapter, so you can keep the authors straight. Compose a response for each player who sent you a message:

. Answer truthfully any questions they've had.  System questions should be answered in public, without pointing towards the one with the question.
. Ponder the current overall situation (especially the most recent messages from all players) while you shuffle the deck.
. Draw three cards: past, present, and future.
  . For the first card, describe something that happened recently, outside their control. They get visions of the entire world, snippets of other events happening far away. Ask a question about what happened.
  . For the second card, describe the result of their most recent orders. Let the card guide whether the orders succeed or not, but err on the side of success without outside interference. Ask a question about what happened.
  . For the third card, describe an opportunity, with or without a cost. Ask a question about that opportunity or its cost.
. Add these questions to the game log, for posterity and so you can keep the thread when responses don't contain enough information to remember the question.

.Example message.
====

(The Magician) You see another man in Rapanu's Library, one heavily-laden with books, climb a bookcase to take one final tome.  He hears footsteps, and runs off into the night. What has escaped its coffin to haunt the library?

(6 of Wands) You see Saladin, bearing a stone game piece (the Tower) and a large wooden bowl (Temperance), entering the library at dawn, proud and upright.  He begins searching for the book, but he will not find it. What is the title of the book Saladin thinks will appease you?

(The Wheel) During Saladin's search, he notices a body out a window to the south, across the river in the marketplace.  The crows are avoiding it, though it's certainly dead.  There's something in its outstretched hand... Why is the marketplace normally empty?
