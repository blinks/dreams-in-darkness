[verse, The National, The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness]
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

== The game

_Dreams in Darkness_ is a game about forces clashing in the dark, eldritch power
and its cost, everpresent fog of war, plans and secrets.

We play to find out which players can achieve their objectives and what happens
to the world as they work towards achieving that goal.

=== The setting

Dark and quiet fantasy, Sumeria and the sea peoples smashed into Napoleonic-era
Europe, unknowable eldritch horror.

=== The players

One player will take the role of *the dreamer*, keeping the world stable and
knowable against the limited vision of the other players. The dreamer should
tell the truth at all times and read orders in the best possible way for the
other players, who are fighting against enough ignorance without getting thrown
more mischief.

Each other player will create a character and be given an objective, and strives
to bring the two together to the best of their creative ability.

These players work together with the dreamer to establish the tone and style of
the game by communicating in two levels: the secret passing of orders and the
public communication between everyone.

=== Playing a session

Play is a loop of orders submitted and results announced. The dreamer tells each
other player what they alone know about the world, and might announce to the
table things that anyone would notice or rumors that are spreading. The players
then negotiate and discuss and clarify, eventually sending a few sentences of
orders to the dreamer to tell them what will be attempted in the next cycle.
When the dreamer receives orders each turn, they'll roll for each one and write
down the results as if everything was happening at the same time, and the loop
continues.

Each cycle of this loop is a "turn", with days split into morning, midday,
afternoon, dusk, evening, and night turns. Use the time to help narrate what
the world looks like, who might be out and about in the villages and towns, and
remember to describe the weather as it changes.

Orders are short descriptions of what the player wants to do, and should fit on
a 3" by 5" index card writ pretty large, or a line or two of an email. For
clarity, players -- especially those sending emails -- should write the turn
(day and time), the character, and their location as a header. When mentioning a
sphere, players should note the number of dice they'll get for it, so the
dreamer doesn't need any character sheets.

Players will occasionally commune with the dreamer to refresh their hand of
Tarot cards, which are used to augment orders with bargains for more dice or
eldritch power. In-person, these cards are passed with the orders publicly,
while over email you can just mention that you've used it.

NOTE: A game with this many secrets relies heavily on players being trustworthy,
helpful, and prompt. We paraphrase the Love Letter rule: if someone needs
rules to stop them from being a bore, don't invite that player to your game.

== The system

=== The loop

This game is not a conversation, though a conversation should be taking place
while you play. Instead, _Dreams_ is a loop: players gain (1) observations of
the world through the dreamer, then (2) orient themselves with that information
in order to (3) decide what to do next and record that decision as orders,
finally (4) submitting the orders to the test of the dreamer.

NOTE: For more on this kind of cycle, take a look at the history of kriegsspiel
and the "OODA loop".

The dreamer is responsible for tracking the state of the world using maps and
pawns and pencils and paper, keeping this state hidden from the players who
don't have a way of accessing it.

The other players are responsible for tracking the state of their character
using the playbook, hidden hand of Tarot cards, and any other tools they find
helpful, keeping its state hidden from the other players, leaking to the dreamer
only the information necessary to resolve their orders.

This double-blind method of play can make the game a very solitary exercise, so
conversation is encouraged between all players -- no matter where their
characters are on the map, players may discuss events openly. Talk about plans,
make boasts, comment on things the dreamer has publicly announced. If you're in
the same area of the map, you can have a secret conversation, but keep it quick.

=== Actions and Secrets

When you give your action to the dreamer, it's helpful for it to have four
specific parts:

- When: What turn is it? This might seem silly from the non-dreamer side, but
  it's essential when you're handling several secrets at once.
- Task: What are you doing? Think fictionally. What does it look like, and what
  kind of roll do you want to make? In particular, include where you're doing
  these things, as specific as possible. While it might not matter to you, there
  are other people wandering around.
- Intent: What do you want to happen? Think like a player.
- Material: Any bargained card or major arcana ritual attached at the end.

This information helps the dreamer stay organized and also better understand
what you want to do without needing to do a bunch of back-and-forth. Secrets
are much more difficult when they need to make several round trips.

=== Judgment calls

[quote, Alfred Habdank Skarbek Korzybski]
The map is not the territory.

Since the game is an abstraction of a fantasy world, you'll need to make the
occasional judgment call. Everyone can contribute, but one person has final say
over the outcome:

- Which orders are reasonable for a given situation? The player giving the
  orders has the final say.
- How dangerous and how effective is a given order in this circumstance? The
  dreamer has the final say.
- Which consequences are inflicted to manifest the dangers in a given
  circumstance? The dreamer has the final say.
- Does resolving this order call for a dice roll, and which one? The dreamer has
  the final say.
- Which events in the story match the experience triggers for character
  advancement? The players have the final say.

=== Rolling the dice

_Dreams_ uses six-sided dice. The dreamer will roll several at once and read the
single highest result.

- If the highest die is a 6, it's a full success -- things go well. If there's
  more than one 6, it's a critical success -- the character gains some
  additional advantage.

- If the highest die is a 4 or 5, that's a partial success -- they do what they
  were trying to do, but there are consequences: trouble, harm, reduced effect,
  etc.

- If the highest die is 1-3, it's a bad outcome -- things go poorly. They
  probably don't achieve their goal and they suffer complications, too. If they
  passed a card as a bargain, show its downside.

If you ever need to roll for an order where the player hasn't been able to
muster any dice, roll two dice and take the single lowest result. You can't roll
a critical when they have zero dice.

=== Resistance rolls

Describe consequences in public (but avoid details that the player would already
know), successes in private. If a player wants to avoid a consequence (for
themselves or someone else), they should call for a resistance roll in either
salt (for physical consequences) or sulphur (for intangible consequences).

Resistance rolls always succeed, at the cost of stress on the resisting player.
This success might reduce the consequence or eliminate it altogether. Resistance
results are one of the main ways to establish tone in the game.

=== Movement

One of the most common things players will do during the game is move around.

For the dreamer's sanity, the only real locations on the map are towns (corners
and crossroads), roads and rivers (edges), and areas. A character exists on one
of these and that's all the detail you really need to know.

When a character walks, they can make it down two roads/rivers or one normal
area in a turn. When they ride or sail, they can pass three roads/rivers or two
areas.

A character really pushing themselves can move one additional road or river or
area, but it should probably hurt. Complicated areas might take twice as long to
cross (you enter the area on one turn, and exit it on the next), but you
shouldn't have to worry about where you are specifically in there.

== Spheres and alchemicals

There are six spheres in the game that cover what the players might do to
overcome obstacles.

Each sphere has a rating (from zero to four) that tells the dreamer how many
dice to roll when resolving an order under that sphere. This doesn't just
represent skill or training -- you're free to describe _how_ your character
performs that action based on what resources are available to them, what kind of
person they are, and what their associates are capable of.

Maybe your character is strong under the Moon because they're a vast well of
secrets through decades of study, while another character travels with an
entourage of magi that each can tap into a different sense of the worlds beyond.

You choose which sphere applies to the orders you give, by describing what your
character does. Spheres that are poorly suited to the situation may be less
effective and may put the character and their followers in more danger, but the
order will still be valid. Usually, when you send your orders, the dreamer will
make an *orders roll* to see how it turns out, and report back to you.

[quote, H.P. Lovecraft, The Colour out of Space]
It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite.

=== Sun

image::sun.png[Sun,float=left,height=20]
The sphere of raw power and strength. It takes gold to push yourself for a die
under the Sun, while a bargain can be had with cups or pentacles.

Call on the Sun to tear something apart or charge into battle. You could use it
to march towards a better position, but Mars might be better.

=== Mercury

image::mercury.png[Mercury,float=left,height=20]
The sphere of speed and skill. It takes quicksilver to push yourself for a die
under Mercury, while a bargain can be had with wands or swords.

Call on Mercury to intercept an enemy before they reach their goal, or explore
an area, searching for secrets. You could use it to rush past their defenses,
but the Sun might be better.

=== Venus

image::venus.png[Venus,float=left,height=20]
The sphere of persuasion and emotion. It takes copper to push yourself for a
die under Venus, while a bargain can be had with cups or swords.

Call on Venus to negotiate with a neutral party (never another player) or
interrogate a deserter. You could use it to hold steady against an oncoming
charge, but Mars might be better.

=== Moon

image::moon.png[Moon,float=left,height=20]
The sphere of wisdom and secrets. It takes silver to push yourself for a die
under the Moon, while a bargain can be had with wands or cups.

Call on the Moon to seek forbidden knowledge in a safe place, or to use an
artifact's arcane power. You could use it to hide yourself for an ambush, but
Mercury might be better.

=== Mars

image::mars.png[Mars,float=left,height=20]
The sphere of courage and constitution. It takes iron to push yourself for a die
under Mars, while a bargain can be had with wands or pentacles.

Call on Mars to march without rest over roads and clear countryside, or to
steady yourself against an approaching danger. You could use it to delve into an
ancient tomb, but the Moon might be better.

=== Saturn

image::saturn.png[Saturn,float=left,height=20]
The sphere of patience and solitude. It takes lead to push yourself for a die
under Saturn, while a bargain can be had with swords or pentacles.

Call on Saturn to watch and wait patiently with plans to react, or to travel
quietly across hidden paths in small groups. You could use it to go alone to
negotiate with a village leader, but Venus might be better.

=== Salt

image::salt.png[Salt,float=left,height=20]
The attribute of the physical body. Used to resist physical consequences.

Salt's associated spheres are the Sun, Mercury, and Mars.

=== Sulphur

image::sulphur.png[Sulphur,float=left,height=20]
The attribute of the intangible soul. Used to resist spiritual consequences.

Sulphur's associated spheres are Venus, the Moon, and Saturn.

== The playbooks

. Choose a playbook. The dreamer can use chess pieces on a paper map to keep
  track of where everyone is, but that's simpler if folks coordinate with them
  about what they want to choose.

. Draw Major Arcana for your secret objective. (Note: For the playtest, the
  dreamer might give you one specifically.)

. Mark four dots under three different spheres, as you wish. No sphere can have
  a rating of more than two at the beginning of the game.

. Choose a special ability. (Note: For the playtest, there might only be one
  available to you.)

. Record your name, alias, and look.

[verse, The Lost Book of Gideon]
She laid the three stones below the altar,
words of power chanted through her.
The moment arrived, his eyes opened,
and she brought down the dagger.

=== King

You sacrificed much to gain arcane power. A little bit more won’t hurt.

[quote, Paulo Coehlo, The Alchemist]
"What’s the world’s greatest lie?" the boy asked. "It’s this: that at a certain
point in our lives, we lose control of what’s happening to us, and our lives
become controlled by fate. That’s the world’s greatest lie."

- Library of Alexandria: When you commune with the dreamer, keep at most two and
  draw up to seven cards.

=== Queen

Sometimes all you need is the right person in the right place with the right
blade.

[quote, Savielly Tartakower]
It’s always better to sacrifice your opponent’s men.

- A little help from my friends: Whenever you use a face card to bargain, the
  dreamer will give you an ally. Remind them in your orders.

=== Bishop

You follow willingly, in order to act as a conduit for divine power.

- Dreamwalk: From dusk until morning, whenever you rest you can ask a yes or no
  question about the world. The dreamer will answer truthfully.

=== Knight

Swords, horses, and courage solve any problem worth solving.

- Shield of faith: You have one special armor box for resisting something
  fearful. When you use it, tell everyone how you laugh it off.

=== Rook

Talk softly and carry a big siege weapon.

- Sound of the guns: You have artillery. It is frightening to anyone nearby and
  can also hammer adjacent areas with shells.

=== Pawn

You know the land better than anyone — the hidden paths, dark tombs, sacred
places. Your enemies don’t understand what they’re walking into.

[quote, François-André Danican Philidor]
Pawns are the soul of the game.

- Cover your tracks: If someone meets you in battle, they must first suffer a
  consequence of the traps you set wherever you go. They will not learn who set
  these traps in the description. Describe these to the dreamer in your first
  orders, and change them whenever you like.

== Cards

When you commune with the dreamer, keep up to one card in your hand and discard
the rest, then draw back up to five cards from a Tarot deck.

These cards may be played with your orders to bargain for more dice or eldritch
power. Bargains are always a risk. The dreamer will use the card's meaning to
help them decide what happens on a failure.

=== Minor Arcana

Each suit in the minor arcana is connected to three spheres.

- Cups bargain with the Sun, the Moon, or Venus.
- Pentacles bargain with the Sun, Mars, or Saturn.
- Swords bargain with Mercury, Venus, or Saturn.
- Wands bargain with Mercury, the Moon, or Mars.

These bargains will always give you an extra die, and the dreamer will use the
card's meaning to apply some additional effect. You are encouraged to suggest
some effect in the orders you submit, based on your feeling about the card.

=== Major Arcana

As part of your orders for the turn, you may play major arcana in your hand to
trigger its effect. Write a short sentence to tell the dreamer your intention,
and something will happen.

- 0. The Fool sows confusion until the next sunrise.
- I. The Magician transmutes elemental objects and forces.
- II. The High Priestess gives you a mysterious vision of the world.
- III. The Empress births something terrible.
- IV. The Emperor controls another mortal for a critical moment.
- V. The Hierophant gives you specific advice on a subject you choose.
- VI. The Lovers give you a moment alone with someone you know.
- VII. The Chariot enables you to travel quickly for a full day.
- VIII. Strength gives you supernatural power until the next sunset.
- IX. The Hermit gives you vision of a distant location.
- X. Wheel of Fortune calls fate to give you a boon.
- XI. Justice weighs yourself and another on the scales.
- XII. The Hanged Man clears your sight until the next morning.
- XIII. Death ends something.
- XIV. Temperance takes something you have in excess to give something you lack.
- XV. The Devil calls for aid from powers you neither understand nor control.
- XVI. The Tower destroys something utterly.
- XVII. The Star restores something mortal at a cost.
- XVIII. The Moon veils you from mortal vision until you rest or draw blood.
- XIX. The Sun gives you the loyalty of all who see you.
- XX. Judgment raises the dead to do your bidding.
- XXI. The World transports you leagues in an instant.

== Maps

When building the map, the dreamer should find or make a diagram of twenty-two
areas. It should fit on a single sheet of paper.

Each area has one major point of interest. Edges around the area are roads or
waterways. Corners around the area are houses, villages, towns, or cities.
Stopping places, at the crossroads. This helps build a realistic-feeling map
while also making it easy to talk about locations on it.

To decide on the points of interest, shuffle up the major arcana of a tarot deck
and do a reading for the map. For each area, draw a card and decide what it
might mean as a place. Maybe the Tower is a giant sinkhole into which a powerful
people fell. Maybe the Emperor is a mountain fortress from which someone
commands. Use your own intuition, and set the tone of your game through the map.

== Ludography

[verse, Ammurapi]
My father behold, the enemy’s ships came;
my cities were burned, and they did evil things in my country.
Does not my father know that
all my troops and chariots are in the Land of Hatti,
and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka? ...
Thus, the country is abandoned to itself.
May my father know it:
the seven ships of the enemy that came here
inflicted much damage upon us.
