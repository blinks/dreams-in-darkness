== Introduction
Battle Mages is a double-blind free kriegspiel.

- Double-blind: Alice can't see what Charles is doing, nor vice-versa.
- Free: Alice and Charles can give whatever orders they see fit.
- Kriegspiel: Alice and Charles are at war, and someone will win the game.

This makes it a cross between a role-playing game and a wargame, and in fact,
the kriegspiel is where role-playing games came from.

Like a role-playing game, you need to pay attention to what's going on in the
shared fiction, not all of which can be covered by mechanisms in this book.
The moves here aren't meant to limit what orders you can give, but as a
starting point.

Historical kriegspiel games were handled by military officers with enough field
experience that they could look at a situation and make an informed decision
about what would happen.  These moves help a Dispatch with less experience do
the same, and help players understand the range of possible outcomes.

When you do something that these moves don't cover -- as long as it makes sense
in the established fiction -- Dispatch isn't going to tell you it's against the
rules.  Keep that in mind.

=== Battle Mages and Dispatch
One player acts as *Dispatch*, who manages the state of the world.  Everything
that everyone does will go to Dispatch first, so it's an essential role to
fill, if occasionally exhausting.

Because of the weight on their shoulders, it's important to make messages to
Dispatch clear and concise.  They'll do their best to coordinate everything, do
your part to make it as easy as possible.

The rest of the players control *Battle Mages* in a middle-ages continental
conflict.  Mages have a convocation goblet, limited foresight, and the ability
to invoke rituals to cause great magical effects.  They also should probably be
raising armies.

A *Convocation Goblet* is one of a set of ancient relics passed down for
centuries.  When you drink from one, your spirit attends a meeting with all the
other mages that drank at that time.  Law dictates that mages always drink from
the goblet at sunset after an eclipse, to maintain decency and order among
those who control goblets.

Otherwise, *communication is extremely limited.*  Unless you're in the same
area or in the convocation, you should not communicate directly with other
players about the game.  In managing this, the cut-off is when the results come
back from Dispatch.  If you're in the same area at sunrise, and then give
orders to march away, you can still communicate until Dispatch gives results
for sunrise+1.

=== The Tarot Deck
At sunrise each day, Dispatch will *draw income from a tarot deck* for each
mage.  Draws will determine what resources or rituals become available for
them, but they must travel out to the mage if not at home.  Resources match the
four tarot suits (wands, cups, swords, and coins), and rituals are found in the
major arcana.

- Wands: The more wands you spend, the faster you can invoke a given ritual.
- Cups: Feed your forces when they get hungry.
- Swords: Raise new forces and support existing ones.
- Coins: Pay your forces when they ask why they're even doing this.

However, action resolution is deterministic.  There's enough chaos in the
hidden information, no need to add more with dice or cards.

=== Forces
Each force starts out as *7-strength*, which drops as they take conditions.
When a force takes an unnamed condition, mark the top-most unmarked one.

- Fresh: +1 strength if no other conditions marked.
- Hungry and Thirsty: -1 strength until you spend a cup.
- Angry: -1 strength until you rest and spend a coin.
- Exhausted: -1 strength until you rest.
- Injured: -1 strength until you rest and spend a cup.
- Dead: as it says on the tin.

Engagement is a simple hidden bid, where all bid forces take a condition, but
the player(s) who didn't bid the most take _another_ condition.  Your bid is
called your "standing orders", and by default, you'll bid all available forces.

=== The Map

image::map.png[One of many possible maps.]

Mages war over areas of various sizes and shapes.  Each area contains points of
interest and borders into other areas.  Borders could each be roads, or rivers,
or mountains.  Areas hold one primary terrain type, like open grassland,
forests, or marshes.

Smaller areas should be given more difficult terrain, as marching time depends
primarily on the number of areas crossed, not the measured distance between
locations.  In general, stuff exists in an area, not at a specific coordinate.
Stuff can also exist on the border between two areas, or where several meet, or
at a specific point of interest.

North is always up on the map, to reduce confusion.

=== Time and Timestamps
The game begins at sunrise on day 1, with time divided into hourly chunks:

- sunrise, sunrise+1, ..., sunrise+5
- noon, noon+1, ..., noon+5
- sunset, sunset+1, ..., sunset+5
- midnight, midnight+1, ..., midnight+5

When you tell Dispatch what you want to do, put a timestamp in the message for
what game time you're talking about.  That is, when Dispatch sends Alice her
income for the day, she can send back orders for sunrise or any later time.
For example:

> Sunrise: We march for Charlie at Silver Ford.
> Send a message to Rebecca at Archangel's Rest: "We're coming."

== The Initial Convocation
To start the game, Dispatch shuffles up a Tarot deck and draws income three
times for each mage.  Mages also recieve three forces, a team assignment, and a
home area -- they should name their forces, confer with their team, and
(privately, to Dispatch) describe a point of interest in their home area.

When the game starts, there has just been an eclipse.  Mages drink from their
goblets just before sunrise, so everyone will have the opportunity to discuss
-- in public -- whatever they like.

During the convocation, several metagame things must be decided:

- How should players communicate?  (It will be simpler for Dispatch if this is
  the same for all players.)
- How quickly should players respond?  (Both Dispatch and the mages should
  respond promptly, but it's important to set expectations on that, especially
  when playing across multiple time zones.)
- How long until the next convocation?  (By default, this should happen when
  the deck runs out, but it's good to confirm.)

Immediately after the convocation (sunrise), players may send their first
orders.

== Orders
Dispatch will send out messages to note when they're accepting orders, at which
point you have until the agreed-upon time to respond.  (If you wait too long,
the game can just fall apart -- just let people know if you'll be delayed and
you can all work it out like responsible battle mages.)

Orders must be as clear as possible so Dispatch doesn't have to ask any
clarifying questions.  They should start with what time you give them, so
Dispatch can figure out when they apply.  You can give delayed orders, if it
makes sense.  You can order yourself and everyone with you separately, but
don't split up forces -- it's too much work to manage.  For clarity, you should
probably name your forces so it's easy to refer to them.

Some common things you might want to do (and how Dispatch will resolve them)
are below.

*When you march,* commit forces to a direction or destination on the map and
they'll try to get there.  Dispatch will tell you if you run into anything
unexpected, and when you reach your destination.  It takes six hours to cross
an area of open terrain.  Most difficult terrain takes twice as long to cross.

> Noon. Ghost Division, march North to the Well. The Blackguard and myself will
> march West to the next area.

*When you send out a messenger,* provide the exact message you wish to send,
the person you wish to recieve it, and the place you expect them to be.  The
messenger will move at twice normal marching speed until they reach the
destination, and then attempt to find that person to deliver the message.
Messengers can get lost or intercepted, be careful.

> Sunset. To Magus Sverre, at the Well: "Attackers from the Northeast and
> Northwest.  Hold it 'til we get there."

*When you rest your forces in a safe place,* commit your forces for six hours.
You may also recover from conditions that require rest.

> Sunset. We all rest here and recover as much as possible. (Dispatch will
> spend resources as necessary.)

*When you forage a healthy area for resources,* commit one force for three
hours and give it a condition.  Dispatch will draw income for you and describe
how you got it.  Dispatch will also mark the area as depleted (foraging will
fail) for days equal to the last-discarded card's rank.

> Sunrise. Knights of the Well and I march North. Rangers forage here, then
> march North to join us.

*When you drink from your convocation goblet,* Dispatch will tell you who else
is attending the meeting, and you may all communicate freely for that hour.

> Midnight+1: Drink from the goblet.

*When you muster new forces at home,* spend five swords.  If you're not home,
you can send a message back to give them orders.  Otherwise, they'll stay 'til
you pick them up.

== Rituals
When you invoke a ritual you have learned, commit your mage for up to six hours
and spend wands:

.Ritual Costs
|===
|Hours |1  |2 |3 |4 |5 |6
|Wands |13 |8 |5 |3 |2 |1
|===

Dispatch might ask a few clarifying questions, and will tell you what happens
at the end of the invocation time.

=== 0. The Fool
Confuse movement through an area until the next sunrise.  Anything attempting
to move in the chosen area will have their destination randomly determined by
Dispatch.  Messengers will get lost, armies rerouted, and so on.

=== I. The Magician
Tell Dispatch what you sacrifice, and they will draw a card.  They will give
you new resources equal to the lesser of the card draw or the amount you
sacrificed.  If Dispatch draws Major Arcana, you will learn a new ritual.

=== II. The High Priestess
Receive a vision.  Dispatch will tell you something interesting and useful
about the current situation, and might ask you a question or two.  Answer them.

=== III. The Empress
Dispatch will draw two cards and ask which one you want.  You'll get the
resources or ritual on your chosen card immediately, while everyone else will
freely receive the resources or ritual on the other card as additional income
at sunrise.

=== IV. The Emperor
Until the next sunset, you control your armies perfectly.  If you engage with
an enemy in that time, Dispatch will tell you their orders.  If you reply
promptly with new orders, they will replace your standing orders for that
engagement.

=== V. The Hierophant
Ask one question from the following list.  Dispatch will answer truthfully.

- Where's my safest path to X?
- Which enemy is most vulnerable to me?
- Which enemy is the biggest threat?
- What should I be on the lookout for?
- What's X's true position?

=== VI. The Lovers
Choose another mage.  If they accept, you will be able to communicate directly
with them and they with you until the next sunrise.  Otherwise, take a
condition.

=== VII. The Chariot
Choose any amount of nearby people.  All of them can move twice as quickly
until the next sunset.

=== VIII. Strength
Choose any amount of nearby combatants.  All of them fight twice as hard
(doubling their strength) until the next sunset.  Remember your standing
orders, you may need to change them for this time.

=== IX. The Hermit
Choose an area on the map.  Dispatch will tell you what's there, in detail,
including one point of interest.

=== X. [Wheel of] Fortune
Dispatch will secretly draw a card and provide you a boon.  You may or may not
learn of that boon immediately:

- Major Arcana: The ritual will be invoked immediately, at no cost; Dispatch
  may ask questions to determine how.
- Wands: The next time you invoke a ritual, it may be invoked immediately, at
  no cost.  Otherwise, you hold onto this option.  You cannot gain multiple.
- Cups: Everyone traveling with you restores from any one condition.
- Swords: This card's value will be added to your next engagement.
- Coins: You will get income twice next sunrise.

=== XI. Justice
Choose another nearby mage.  If their force is stronger than yours, all their
forces will gain a condition.  Otherwise, all _your_ forces will gain a
condition.

=== XII. The Hanged Man
Gain immunity to all ritual effects until the next sunrise.  Dispatch will tell
you if any rituals were avoided, what they were, and who invoked them.

=== XIII. Death
Everyone in a nearby area gains a condition.

=== XIV. Temperance
Balance out your resources.  The thing you have most of will convert into what
you have least of until they balance.  In the case of a tie, you decide.

=== XV. The Devil
Summon a monster and give it a task.  It is not subtle.  Dispatch will control
it until the task is complete, and then it will be freed.  At that time,
Dispatch will draw to determine its fate:

- Major Arcana: The monster remains, allied to nobody, destructive to all.
- Otherwise: The monster is pulled back to where it came.

If Dispatch cannot interpret your task, or if they think it's impossible or too
vague, the ritual will fail.  Your time and resources are still spent.

=== XVI. The Tower
Destroy a nearby constructed work, as if by explosives.

=== XVII. The Star
Everyone you choose may recover from the Wounded condition.

=== XVIII. The Moon
Everyone you choose becomes invisible until the next sunrise.  Tell Dispatch if
you want to avoid engagement.  Invisibility is lost when you draw blood.

=== XIX. The Sun
Everyone you choose may recover from the Angry condition.

=== XX. Judgement
Raise the recently-dead in your area to fight as 2-strength forces.  Any living
forces (including your own) gain a condition when interacting with dead forces.
Dead forces that take the wounded condition are destroyed.  Mark other
conditions, but they have no effect on the dead force's strength.

=== XXI. The World
Choose people and a destination.  Everyone that allows it will be teleported to
that destination when the ritual completes.  Dispatch will not tell them the
destination when asking if they allow it, you must do that.  Or not.

Your loyal forces will always allow it.

== Dispatch
You've got a bunch of triggers that you need to track in the background.

=== Sunrise

*Forces that didn't rest* gain Exhausted.

*Draw income for each mage* and tell them what it is -- mages have foresight.
The ritual or resources on it will head towards them at twice normal marching
speed.  They can get lost or intercepted.

=== Encounters

*When two mages are in the same area,* tell each of them about the other.  If
the area is open terrain, also describe the forces each commands.

*When two or more armies meet in battle,* consult each commander's standing
orders to determine what forces to commit.  All committed forces gain a
condition.  The force(s) in minority gain another.  Report the battle to all
nearby mages.
