[verse, The National, The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness]
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

== The basics
A secrets-filled, competitive role-playing game set in a Napoleonic-era dark
fantasy for three to fifteen players about the end of a world.

=== Preparations
Get as many people as you can, divided into two roughly-equal teams and one
dreamer. Since this is the dreamer's book, that's you.

Dreams in Darkness can be played in one long-ish session locally, or over a
bunch of messages remotely, you pick. There's a definite end to each game,
though: try to reach it.

Each game starts with a situation, primed for conflict between the two sides.
Fill in the details of the situation and let the game begin.

=== Kriegsspiel
Role-playing may be a conversation, but Dreams in Darkness is a kriegsspiel,
different in two primary ways: fog of war and limited communication.

Both of these limitations seal players off into their own areas, with knowledge
only of their immediate surroundings, any communication delayed and potentially
intercepted. These are essential to the experience, don't play around them!

These rules mediate how players wander through the fog, so everyone can make
informed decisions about what could happen.

=== The ancients
Two players can escape these limitations: the ancients. These are the two
warring sides, and sit at the same table with the dreamer. All the other
players are disciples that follow one of the ancients, and can commune with
them in person once each day.

=== Orders and cards
Disciples wander through the fog by giving orders. All the character playbooks
list the same set of basic orders, plus each playbook lists special orders for
just that archetype.

The rule for orders is that the dreamer will interpret them to the best of
their ability. Be clear if you want to be understood. No takebacks, no
contingency plans. Orders must be simple and direct.

The ancients each hold a small hand of Tarot cards, representing their power.
Minor Arcana can be granted to disciples to aid them for a turn, increasing the
spheres that match. Major Arcana are artifacts that can be granted to a
disciple.

=== The spheres
The spheres are:

The Sun:: A conflict of raw power or strength. When you charge into battle or
  tear something apart, count Cups and Pentacles in your favor.

Mercury:: A conflict of speed or skill. When you run to intercept an enemy or
  carefully explore a ruin, count Wands and Swords in your favor.

Venus:: A conflict of persuasion. When you negotiate with a neutral party or
  interrogate a deserter, count Cups and Swords in your favor.

The Moon:: A conflict of wisdom, secrets, or magic. When you cast a spell or
  seek out forbidden knowledge, count Wands and Cups in your favor.

Mars:: A conflict of courage or constitution. When you march without rest or
	hold steady in the face of a charge, count Wands and Pentacles in your favor.

Saturn:: A conflict of patience or solitude. When you depend on critical timing
  or you travel alone, count Swords and Pentacles in your favor.

Jupiter:: A conflict of pure luck. When the fates matter more than anything else,
  count any Minor Arcana in your favor.

=== Cycle of play
Each day is divided into six (uneven) turns: morning, midday, afternoon, dusk,
evening, and night. Each turn:

. The ancients get a new tarot card.
. The dreamer presents each disciple with their current situation.
. Disciples write orders, optionally communing with their ancients.
. The dreamer resolves orders, asking ancients for cards as necessary.

== The playbooks
Disciples choose from these six playbooks before play. Within a team, playbooks
should be unique.

=== King
You sacrificed much to gain arcane power. A little bit more won't hurt.

=== Queen
Sometimes all you need is the right person in the right place with the right
knife.

=== Bishop
You follow willingly, in order to act as a conduit for divine power.

=== Knight
Swords, horses, and courage solve any problem worth solving.

=== Rook
Talk softly and carry a big siege weapon.

=== Pawn
You know the land better than anyone -- the hidden paths, dark tombs, sacred
places. Your enemies don't understand what they're walking into.

=== The basic orders
Every disciple gets all of the basic orders. These are:

- Charge into battle
- Tear something apart
- Intercept a moving enemy
- Explore a hidden place
- Negotiate with a neutral party
- Interrogate a deserter
- Invoke arcane power
- Seek forbidden knowledge
- March without rest
- Hold steady
- Watch and wait
- Travel alone

== The map
Get or draw a 22-area map. Shuffle up the major arcana, and for each area draw a card:

|===

[verse, Ammurapi]
My father behold, the enemy’s ships came;
my cities were burned, and they did evil things in my country.
Does not my father know that
all my troops and chariots are in the Land of Hatti,
and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka? ...
Thus, the country is abandoned to itself.
May my father know it:
the seven ships of the enemy that came here
inflicted much damage upon us.

== Character creation

[verse,H.P. Lovecraft, The Colour out of Space.]
It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite.

Print out two sets of playbooks and give a set to each ancient. Within each
team, have everybody choose one, no duplicates. Set the rest aside.

You'll also need enough copies of the map so everyone can get one, some
pencils, and a deck of tarot cards.

Then, hold an auction for each sphere in turn (from the outermost to the
innermost):

. Saturn: patience and solitude.
. Mars: courage and constitution.
. The Moon: wisdom, secrets, and magic.
. Venus: charisma and persuasion.
. Mercury: speed and skill.
. The Sun: raw power and strength.

Players have 150 points to spend in the auction. Bids are irrevocable and
nonrefundable. The final bid for each player in each sphere is their score in
that attribute. After all bids are complete, players may spend leftover points
to increase their score in any sphere, but not past a bid rank.

That is, if Alice got 54 in Mars and Bob got 35, he could spend up to 19 points
getting up to 54. When tied, the score that was initially bid higher always
wins. (In the case where two players tie in different spheres, TODO.)

=== Goals
- To the ancients: play to win creatively.
- To the disciples: play to satisfy your obligations.
- To the dreamer: play to find out what happens.

[verse,The Lost Book of Gideon.]
She laid the three stones below the altar,
words of power chanted through her.
The moment arrived, his eyes opened,
and she brought down the dagger.

== The situation
A ritual has begun that will grant one ancient unlimited power. The other
ancient needs to prevent it from doing so.

Ask the defender, secretly: where on the map is the ritual taking place?
Ask the attacker, secretly: which direction are you approaching from?
Tell everyone: at sundown on the third day, the ritual will complete.

== The basic orders
The rule for orders is: be clear. The dreamer will interpret your orders to the
best of their ability, without asking for clarification.

Orders often ask you to call upon a sphere; this is a conflict between you and
your opposition, where your result is based on the difference between your
scores. (If there's no opposition, compare to zero.) If you have fewer points
in the sphere than your opposition, it's a miss.  Otherwise, it's a hit. The
difference in points is your margin of success (like +10) or failure (like -4).

If your ancient grants you a card, it might be very helpful (+25 if the minor arcana
suit is good for that sphere), or slightly helpful (+10 if it doesn't match), or
not helpful at all (-X for major arcana based on its rank, but they grant you
an artifact if you hit anyway).

=== Charge
When you *charge into battle*, name your enemy and call upon the Sun. On a
miss, your courage fails you and the charge stops short of hand-to-hand combat.
Otherwise, take a morale point from them. On a +10, they also rout to an
adjacent area.

=== Break
When you *tear something apart* or break something down, name your method and
your target and call upon the Sun. On a hit, it's gone.

=== Intercept
When you *intercept a moving enemy*, name the enemy and where you catch them
and call upon Mercury. On a hit, you catch them. On a +10, you catch them by
surprise.

=== Explore
When you *explore the area*, searching for secrets, describe what you saw that
made you curious and call upon Mercury. On a hit, the dreamer will tell you
something interesting about the area. On a +10, the dreamer will tell you how
it's also useful, otherwise you'll have to make it useful on your own.

=== Negotiate
When you *negotiate with a neutral party*, name the party and what you want
from them and call upon Venus. On a hit, they do what you want. On a +10, they
don't ask for anything in return.

=== Interrogate
When you *interrogate a deserter*, ask three questions and call upon Venus. The
dreamer will answer your questions. On a miss, one answer will be true. On a
hit, two answers. On a +10, they'll all be true.

The dreamer won't tell you which answers are true, nor how many.

=== Invoke
When you *use an artifact's arcane power*, name how it fulfills your desires
and call upon the Moon. On a hit, there isn't a catch. On a +10, it works
better than you expected.

=== Quest
When you *seek forbidden knowledge* in a safe place, name what you seek and
call upon the Moon. On a hit, you know how to get it. On a +10, nobody else
knows it exists.

=== Forced march
When you *march without rest*, describe your route and intended destination
and call upon Mars. On a hit, you get there. On a +10, you gain morale. On a
miss, you stumble across something unexpected.

=== Steady
When you *steady yourself*, name what you expect and call upon Mars. On a hit,
what you expect doesn't shake you, you stand firm against it: take a bonus to
defending against it equal to your margin of success.

=== Watch
When you *watch and wait patiently*, name two contingency plans and call upon
Saturn. On a hit, you'll take a plan that matches your situation. On a +10,
you'll take the best plan.

=== Traverse
When you *travel quietly across the countryside*, name a neighboring area and
call upon Saturn. On a hit, you reach it without being noticed. On a +10, you
find something interesting on the way.
